# keycha1n project

open-source tool for Raspberry Pi jailbreak dongle (keycha1n)

## What is keycha1n?

keycha1n is an open source auto-invoking jailbreak tool for Apple devices vulnerable to the checkm8 exploit.
It is meant to be installed on single-board computers like the Raspberry Pi and written in Python.

*keycha1n is still in development*

## Information

You need to use python2 in order to run this application.
For development, I personally used python 2.7 so I always recommend using the same interpreter.
