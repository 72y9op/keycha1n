# keycha1n project

open-source auto invoker for the checkra1n jailbreak (https://checkra.in) created with checkm8 exploit

## What is keycha1n?

keycha1n is an open source auto-invoking jailbreak tool for Apple devices vulnerable to the checkm8 exploit.
It is meant to be installed on single-board computers like the Raspberry Pi and written in Python.

*keycha1n is still in development*

## Information

You need to use python2 in order to run this application.
For development, I personally used python 2.7 so I always recommend using the same interpreter.

## Advanced

checkra1n for linux is out, we noticed some bugs with it : 

(**iPhone 5s, 12.4.1, freeze at runtime**)

For the OS I look for a fairly light OS that can execute the requested scripts, so I found BootRa1n !

Thank you for always following us despite our absence !
